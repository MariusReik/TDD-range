# TDD Range Implementation

This project implements a generic Range class using Test Driven Development (TDD) with JUnit.

The range represents values between a low value (included) and a high value (excluded).

The project includes:
- Integer range implementation
- Generic Comparable range
- LocalDate range tests
- TimeOfDay class
- TimeOfDay range tests (e.g. meeting overlap)

The goal of the assignment was to practice:
- Test Driven Development
- Simple design and refactoring
- Working with generics and Comparable
